            <p>If you're an everyday citizen, you likely feel helpless when you see issues detached from your personal life. Find out what you can do to turn your sympathy into help.</p>
            <p>If you're an activist, you probably find yourself frustrated when there's a lot of sympathy for your important cause but not as much action. Make that action accessible to those who want to help.</p>
            <p>If you're someone with a platform; most of the valuable help activists need is straightforward, just not known by those who are willing. Use your platform and share it with your following. Apply that impact at scale.</p>
